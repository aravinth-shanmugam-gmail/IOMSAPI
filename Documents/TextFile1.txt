This is the description of the solution.
I want to create a project for managing a small business. 
It will include order maagement, and product management (inventory) and a simple portal to display the products on sale, available for customers to place orders.
For now this will be only a web application.
This project is to use only microsoft technologies and Azure for hosting.
The project will be developed in C# with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core. 
Backend will be SQL Server hosted on Azure.

Requirements on the architecture:
All communication between the client and the server will be done using REST API.
This will follow the CQRS design pattern and the Mediator pattern.

Inventory - contains all the details on the products availble for sale, as well as products used to make products that are available for sale. 
Inventory module will be used by business owner to manage the products.
	- Define products with name, description, price, quantity in stock, photo
	- Add /update / remove products
	- Add / updte / remove product components (supplies or raw materials)

Web portal - is the market place where products from the inventory are displayed for customers to place orders.
  - products listed by catogories, and filterable by the clients
  - clients can see the details of the product and place orders (For now no payment processing is required, but while checkout, payment can be done via scanning a QR code for the business owners bank account))
  - clients can see the status of their orders
  - Users are not required to login to view products, but to place orders they need to login.

Order management - contains all the details of the orders placed by the customers.
  - Order details include the products ordered, quantity, price, total amount, status of the order
  - Order status can be one of the following: Placed, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled
  - Business owner can change the status of the order
  - Business owner can see the list of orders placed, and filter by status
  - Business owner can see the details of the order and update the status of the order

While the Web portal is open to all, the Inventory and Order management modules are only accessible to the business owner. And hence can be visually as simple as possible.

Code repository will be github, and the project will be deployed to Azure.
Database will be hosted on Azure SQL Server.
Visual Studio will be used for development.
